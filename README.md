# myfirstshinyapp
Welcome to my first shiny app. This is work in progress so changes to the app are expected to happen. Nevertheless, this app provides solutions to a wide array of different situations that you may encounter during developing your very own Shiny app.  

Important:
This app uses Shinydashboard and therefore you must install it in order to run the app. Simply paste the lines below:
library(devtools)
install_github("nik01010/dashboardthemes")

Should any problem persist when running the app, you can see it running through the shinyapps.io server here:

Cheers and have a good day.
